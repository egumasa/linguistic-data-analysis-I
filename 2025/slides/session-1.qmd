# What is a corpus

## What is the first thing that come to your mind about `corpus`?

## A linguistic Corpus

A linguistic corpus is:

- searchable digital collection of
- real-world language use
- often accompanied by meta-data describing the contextual parameters

(To be explored more in session 2)


## Corpus documents language use in real-world

![COCA example](../../assets/session-1/COCA-context.png)


## What do corpora contain?

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

- language samples produced in the **wild** for specific communicative purposes
  - **Written language**: 
    - Magazines
    - News Paper
    - Blog
  - **Spoken language**:
    - *transcriptions* of spoken exchanges
      - TV or radio shows
      - Conversations

:::


## Corpus can be useful to answer research question about language use

Corpus can give you answers if you have good question and good search strategy.

- how many times X occurs in Corpus A
- how many times X occures with Y
- how many times X occurs in the subsections of Corpus B


## Come up with several English words for the following category

- cell phone
- mobile phone
- smart phone

## You can construct following research questions

### Open-ended question

- How does the frequency of `cell phone` changed over time?
- Which region uses `cell phone` more frequently than others? 

### Close-end deductive question 

- Does British use `cell phone` more often than `mobile phone`?


## Set up `English-Corpora.org account`

- Visit [English-Corpora.org](https://www.english-corpora.org/corpora.asp)

## how many times does `cell phone` occur in News written in English?

## how many times does `mobile phone` occur in News written in English?

![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-YEAR2.png)


## Comparision

![cell-phone](../../assets/session-1/cell-phone-YEAR2.png)

![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-YEAR2.png)


## Which region uses `cell phone` more frequenty than `mobile phone`?

![cell-phone](../../assets/session-1/cell-phone-REGION2.png)


## How about `mobile phone`?

![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-REGION2.png)


## Answer

- How does the frequency of `cell phone` changed over time?
  - The use of cell phone tends to decline.
- Which region uses `cell phone` more frequently than others?

# What is corpus linguistics?

## Corpus linguistics

**Corpus linguistics** = the investigation of linguistic research question that have been framed _in terms of the conditional distribution of linguisitc phenomena_ in a _linguistic corpus_.

(Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 56)


## Corpus linguistics =

- the investigation of **linguistic research question**

- that have been framed _in terms of **the conditional distribution of linguisitc phenomena**_ 

::: {style="color: gray"}
- in a _**linguistic corpus**_.

(Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 56)

## Research Questions 

With corpus we can ask questions:

- How does X change over TIME?
- How does X differ by REGION?
- How does X vary by GENRE?
- What words occur with X?

These comparisons help us understand language patterns


## Linguistic Research Questions - Examples

Corpus-based linguistic research

- What are relationships between processing speed and language frequency

Learner Corpus Research:

- What kind of vocabulary do second-language learners with varying proficiency levels produce?
- What grammatical structure emerge later in a longitudinal corpus (as they develop)?


## Assignment 1 Preview

By the end of today, you'll be able to:

- Ask your own research question
- Search corpus to find relevant results
- Interpret what you find
- Write up your discoveries

**Start thinking**: Are there any English expression or construction you want to learn more?

---

<!-- ## The conditional distribution of linguistic phenomena

## Corpus linguistics looks into **(conditional) distribution** 

- (roughly speaking) frequency (= occurrence) of a phenomena
  
  → How many times X occurs?
  → How many times X occurs with Z?

- **conditional** 

  → How does X occur given Y?


## Examples

![Frequency of Dog](../../assets/session-1/DOG.png)


## More about conditional distribution

Segment corpus and calculate occurrences by: 

- genres (written vs spoken)
- year (1970s vs 2000s)
- geographical region (British vs American)
- etc.

## Conditional distribution of Dog across genre and year

# About this course

## Course description

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

This 5-day introduction:

- covers key concepts in corpus linguistics and learner corpus research

- teaches you how to conduct simple corpus searches using Concordance software

- gives you an overview of methods to investigate conditional distributions (e.g., frequency, co-occurrences) of vocabulary, multiword units, and grammatical items.

- introduces foundational methods to identify linguisitic phenomena using corpus and how to know about their distribution

- discusses important applications of corpus methods in applied linguistic (second language) research

:::

## About the course website

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

The course materials are available through the following two:

- Course website
  - We use the website to communicate course schedules, plans, and slides.

- Google Classroom
  - We use Google Classroom for assignment submission, and distributing Readings and Corpus data.
