# What is a corpus

## What is the first thing that come to your mind about `corpus`?

## A linguistic Corpus

A linguistic corpus is:

- searchable digital collection of
- real-world language use
- often accompanied by meta-data describing the contextual parameters

(To be explored more in session 2)

## Corpus documents language use in real-world

![COCA example](../../assets/session-1/COCA-context.png)


## What do corpora contain?

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

- language samples produced in the **wild** for specific communicative purposes
  - **Written language**: 
    - Magazines
    - News Paper
    - Blog
  - **Spoken language**:
    - *transcriptions* of spoken exchanges
      - TV or radio shows
      - Conversations

:::


## How do we use corpus?

Corpus can give you **answers** on how people use language.

::: {.incremental}
- How often does X occur in Corpus A?
- How often does X occure with Y?
- In what context does X occur?
:::

## Word Naming time. What is the following object?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![What's the name of these?](../../assets/session-1/phone.jpg)
:::
::: {.column}
::: {.incremental}
- cell phone
- mobile phone
- smart phone
:::
:::
:::



## Research questions about 

::: {style = "font-size: 85%"}

### Open-ended question

- How does the frequency of `cell phone` changed over time?
- Which region uses `cell phone` more frequently than `mobile phone`? 

### Close-end deductive question 

- Does British use `cell phone` more often than `mobile phone`?

:::

## Set up `English-Corpora.org account`

- Visit [English-Corpora.org](https://www.english-corpora.org/corpora.asp)

## how many times does `cell phone` occur in News written in English?

![cell-phone](../../assets/session-1/cell-phone-YEAR2.png)

## how many times does `mobile phone` occur in News written in English?

![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-YEAR2.png)


## Comparision


![cell-phone](../../assets/session-1/cell-phone-YEAR2.png)
![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-YEAR2.png)


## Which region uses `cell phone` more frequenty?

![cell-phone](../../assets/session-1/cell-phone-REGION2.png)


## How about `mobile phone`?

![mobile-phone](../../assets/session-1/mobile-phone-REGION2.png)


## Answer to the research questions

- How does the frequency of `cell phone` changed over time?
  - The use of cell phone tends to decline.
- Which region uses `cell phone` more frequently than others? 
  - cell phone: US; Pakistan; Jamaica 
  - mobile phone: Philippines;  

→ You can get quantitative insights into how certain language is used

## Research Questions for corpus-based research

With corpus we can ask questions:

- How does X change over **TIME**?
- How does X differ by **REGION**?
- How does X vary by **GENRE**?

We can learn patterns of language use in relation to extra-linguistic factors.

## The X in corpus linguistics

In corpus linguistics, we not only identify *words* but also:

- **Morphemes** (e.g., *-ness;* *pre-*; *-ed*)
- **Syntactic constructions** (e.g., *by `AGENT`*; relativa clauses)
- **Multiword sequences** (e.g., collocation *significant role*)

::: {style = "color:gray"}
- Pronunciation (segmental; prosodic features)
:::

→ In this course, we focus on lexico-grammatical features

## Questions?

---

<!-- ## The conditional distribution of linguistic phenomena

## Corpus linguistics looks into **(conditional) distribution** 

- (roughly speaking) frequency (= occurrence) of a phenomena
  
  → How many times X occurs?
  → How many times X occurs with Z?

- **conditional** 

  → How does X occur given Y?


## Examples

![Frequency of Dog](../../assets/session-1/DOG.png)


## More about conditional distribution

Segment corpus and calculate occurrences by: 

- genres (written vs spoken)
- year (1970s vs 2000s)
- geographical region (British vs American)
- etc.

## Conditional distribution of Dog across genre and year

## Course description

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

This 5-day introduction:

- covers key concepts in corpus linguistics and learner corpus research

- teaches you how to conduct simple corpus searches using Concordance software

- gives you an overview of methods to investigate conditional distributions (e.g., frequency, co-occurrences) of vocabulary, multiword units, and grammatical items.

- introduces foundational methods to identify linguisitic phenomena using corpus and how to know about their distribution

- discusses important applications of corpus methods in applied linguistic (second language) research


:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain what corpus linguistics is and how corpus linguistics can help learn linguistic phenomena
- Search for and select available corpora relevant to their own research
- Discuss design issues related to language corpora for specific research purposes
- Apply introductory corpus linguistic analyses (e.g., frequency analysis, concordancing, collocation analysis, POS tagging, and dependency parsing) to preprocessed corpora
- Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of a corpus linguistic approach to linguistic analysis

## Course Components

- Lectures and tutorials
- Daily Hands-on activities
- Mini-corpus labs
- Final project (will talk more)
