# Session overview

 
## üéØ Learning Objectives

> By the end of this session, students will be able to:
> 
> - Conduct KWIC searches on [English-Corpora.org](https://www.english-corpora.org/)
> - Sort KWIC search results to obtain qualitative observation about language use
> - Use advanced search strings such as regular expression to fine-tune the search results

## Task A - Simple word search

## First corpus search

- Let's start our journey.

- First of all, let's search the following word in COCA.

  - run


## Result of dog


* You might get slightly different results.

## Result of run

![Search - run](../../assets/session-3/simple-search-run.png)


* You might get slightly different results.


# Task A.2 - LEMMA search

## LEMMA search

- Lemma is a group of word form for the head-word with grammatical inflection.
- You can search LEMMA in English-Corpora.org through Capital letters.
- The search methods will depend on the corpus tool you use.

## LEMMA search

# Task B - Basic KWIC

## Concordances (or KWIC)

- Now you know how many times XX occurs in COCA, you want to see the context in which XX occur.

- This goal can be accomplished with KWIC search. 


## KWIC view 

1. Go back to `SEARCH` window.

## KWIC view 

2. Click on the + button in the search menu and enter your search word.

## KWIC view 

3. The result is displayed. Default sort : R1 > R2 > R3

## Sorting KWIC window

- Now let's sort the results according to the position in context.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/KWIC-sort.png)


## Sorting words

You can sort the words.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/KWIC-sorting.gif)


## Let's Try: KWIC

- Choose a word that you want to see the context for.

- Search the word with `KWIC`.

- Sort the word in the following way.
  - Default: R1 > R2 > R3
  - Custom 1: L1 > L2 > L3
  - Custom 2: L1 > R1 > R2

## How to get Custom 1 and 2

# Task C - Chart function

## Chart function

- Now that we learned how to conduct concordance search, let's experiment with some `CHART` function.

- This allows you to return frequency by sections of of COCA (= conditional frequency).

## Search `radio` using CHART

- Go to Search Tab, select, `CHART` and enter `radio`

![Chart search](../../assets/session-3/Chart-radio.png)

## Search `radio` using CHART
- You will get the following:

# Task D - Basic Regular Expressions

## Regular expressions

Regular expression (Ê≠£Ë¶èË°®Áèæ) allows you to search corpus through "pattern matching".

- Have you ever used (*) asterisk in your web search?
- This is one of the regular expression (= wild card)


## Using wild card in search

- Let's go back to `List` search.
- Enter "a * of the"
- What result do you expect with this search?

- Don't turn to the next page YET!!!

## Result with `a * of the`

- ![](../../assets/session-3/search-with-wild-card.png)

## More search methods


- You can check how to use other search methods in English-Corpora.org

# Supplementary (If there is still time ...)

# Task E - Collocation

## Collocation search

- This is main topic for Day 3.
- Briefly, `collocates` search allows us to search for co-occurring words within specified window.

## Collocation search

1. Select `Collocates`

## Collocation search

2. Enter search word

## Collocation search

- Optional enter the word to look for

## Collocation search

3. Specify window 

- How distant do you search for the collocates
