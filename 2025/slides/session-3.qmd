## Goals and Overview 

This assignment aims to help you practice the following skills:

- Articulating linguistic research questions for corpus-driven research
- Explaining corpus choices and analysis approach for basic corpus search
- Interpreting and describing the basic concordance search results

## Goals and overview

- **Task 1**: Constructing corpus-search research question and hypothesis
- **Task 2**: Methods
- **Task 3**: Result

## Task 1: Research question and hypothesis

In this task, you are asked to articulate your research question and hypothesis for your first corpus assignment. 

### Research question:

- Research questions should be answerable. 
- Write one (or two related) research questions you would like to answer through this assignment.

## Task 1: Research question and hypothesis

### Hypothesis:

- Once you decided on research question, state your hypothesis.
- Write a short paragraph stating your hypothesis and why you think your research hypotheses may be true.

## Task 2: Methods

In this task, you are asked to describe the methods choice of your corpus search. This should include justifications for the corpora used, type of corpus search used.

### Corpora

- Which corpora or sub-section of a corpus would you conduct a search on? Why? Justify your choice in a paragraph.

## Task 2: Methods (cont'd)

### Search Methods and Plan

- What corpus search methods would you choose and why? In this assignment, search methods mainly include methods available through English-Corpora.org, including `LIST`, `Chart`, `Collocates`, `Compare` and `KWIC`. 
- In what way are you planning to conduct the search and what kind of information are you expecting from it?
 

## Task 3: Result

In this part of the assignment, you are asked to describe the search results and provide interpretations on the findings.

- **Corpus search results**: Provide some numbers or discourse samples based on your corpus search. This can be frequency list, table with frequency counts, or a copy of KWIC results.

## Recap: The Scientific Research Cycle

Remember from Session 2:

1. Verbalize your question
2. Formulate research questions  
3. Formulate hypothesis
4. Choose appropriate corpus
5. **→ Operationalize** 
6. **→ Test & Evaluate** 


# Part 2: Operationalizing Your Search

## What does "operationalize" mean?

::: {.callout-important}
## Operationalization

"an explicit and unambiguous description of a set of operations that are performed to identify and measure that construct." (Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 77)
:::

- Defining exactly WHAT to search
- Deciding HOW to search it
- Being explicit about your choices

::: {.callout-note}
### Measure of height
- How to operationalize "height"?
  - Meter? Feet?
:::


# Task A - Simple word search

## First corpus search

- Let's operationalize a foundational concept in linguistic research, word.

- **Concept to operationalize**: The word "run"
  
**What is possible operationalization?**

That is, what search term would you like to enter below?

![Search field](../../assets/session-3/search-box.png)


## Result of the search with `run`

- Yes, you now get the frequency result (= `264014`).
- You might get slightly different results.

![Search - run](../../assets/session-3/simple-run.png)


## Let's look at the context

- Wait a minute... where is `runs`, `ran`, and `running`?
![`run` in context](../../assets/session-3/run-context.gif)

## Thinking about the operationalization

- Now we recognized that the word `run` was just one of the possible forms of the *headword* run.

- If we were thinking to retrieve all the occurence of the word "run" then we were imprecise. 
- What should we do?

## Lemma

- **Lemma**: A headword and all the inflected form derived from it.

  RUN: 
    - run, ran, runs, running... etc.

## Refining our operationalization

- **Concept**: All forms of "run"
- **Better operationalization**: Search for LEMMA

# Task A.2 - LEMMA search

## LEMMA search

- You can search LEMMA in English-Corpora.org through Capital letters.
- The search methods will depend on the corpus tool you use.

## LEMMA search

![Searching lemma - run](../../assets/session-3/run-lemma.png)

## LEMMA search result - run

![Search result](../../assets/session-3/run-lemma-result.png)


## Task A.2 - POS search

Now you might wonder:

- **Research question**: "How often is 'run' used as a noun vs. verb?"

→ This is even more precise operationalization of word by its grammatical category.

## Specifying Part Of Speech (POS)

You can use POS tag like the following .

::: {style = "font-size: '85%'"}

| Category | Simple tag | Symbol | Example |
|------|----|----|-----|
| Common noun   | NOUN | N | `run_N` |
| Proper Nouns  | NAME | NP | `Sendai_N` |
| All nouns  | NOUN+ | N+ | `sun_N+`, `Sendai_N+` |
| Lexical verbs | VERB | V | `run_V` |
| All verbs | VERB+ | V | `run_V+`, `do_V+` |

:::

## Specifying Part Of Speech (POS)

::: {style = "font-size: '85%'"}

| Category | Simple tag | Symbol | Example |
|----|----|----|----|
| Adjectives | ADJ | J | `simple_J` |
| Adverbs | ADV | R | `clear_R` |

:::

See [this page for more information of POS in English-Corpora.org](https://www.english-corpora.org/help/word-phrase.asp#pos)

## the word `run` used as noun

- Search occurrences of `run` that are used as nouns.
  
## the word `run` used as noun

Search: `run_N`

![run - as noun](../../assets/session-3/run-noun.png)
  

## Your turn: Operationalize these concepts

- The word "chair" as a verb only


# Task B - Basic KWIC

## Concordances (or KWIC)

- Now we know frequency of X in COCA, but what about context?

**KWIC** = Key Word In Context

KWIC will give us insights into how each word is used in context.

## KWIC view 

1. Go back to `SEARCH` window.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/SearchView.png)


## KWIC view 

2. Click on the + button in the search menu and enter your search word.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/coffee-KWIC.png)

## KWIC view 

3. The result is displayed. Default sort : R1 > R2 > R3

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/KWIC-basic.png) 

## Sorting KWIC window

- Now let's sort the results according to the position in context.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/KWIC-sort.png)


## Sorting words

You can sort the words.

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/KWIC-sorting.gif)

## Sorting to find patterns

Sorting helps identify:
- Common phrases
- Grammatical patterns  
- Semantic preferences

## Let's Try: KWIC

- Choose a word that you want to see the context for.

- Search the word with `KWIC`.

- Sort the word in the following way.
  - Default: R1 > R2 > R3
  - Custom 1: L1 > L2 > L3
  - Custom 2: L1 > R1 > R2

## How to get Custom 1 and 2

![KWIC search](../../assets/session-3/sorting-options.gif)

## Practice: Finding patterns

Search "prove" (lemma) and sort by:
1. R1 (what follows "prove"?)
2. L1 (what precedes "prove"?)

What patterns do you notice?

# Task C 

**Research question**: How does frequency of `lol` change across time?

## Chart function

CHART shows frequency across:
- Genres
- Time periods
- Text types

- This allows you to return frequency by sections of of COCA (= conditional frequency).

## Search `lol` using CHART

- Go to Search Tab, select, `CHART` and enter `lol`


## Search `lol` using CHART

- You will get the following:
- What do you notice here?

![Search - lol](../../assets/session-3/lol_overview.png)

## Interpreting the distribution

What does this tell us about "lol"?
- Genre preferences?
- Formality levels?
- Change over time?

- Describe the frequency pattern looking at `PER MIL` row.

## Summary

CHART function can be used to get frequency across:
- Genres
- Time periods
- Text types

# Task D 

**Research question**: What is most frequent word that ends with derivational mopheme `-ness`?


## Regular expressions

Regular expression (正規表現) allows you to search corpus through "pattern matching".

- Have you ever used (*) asterisk in your web search?
- This is one of the regular expression (= wild card)


## Using regular expression to get words with specific morpheme

Any idea for operationalizing derivational morphemes?

- **Operationalization**: `*ness`

## Results of `*ness`

![Search results *ness](../../assets/session-3/ness-derivation.png)


## Using wild card for lexicalized pattern

- Let's go back to `List` search.
- Enter "a * of the"
- What result do you expect with this search?

- Don't turn to the next page YET!!!

## Result with `a * of the`

- ![a * of the](../../assets/session-3/search-with-wild-card.png)

This helps find:
- Fixed phrases with variable slots
- Grammatical frames
- Idiomatic expressions

## More search methods

- You can check how to use other search methods in English-Corpora.org 
  [here](https://www.english-corpora.org/help/word-phrase.asp)


## More complex searches

Which is more frequent?
- `exciting` or `excited`?

- **RQ**: Is there any reletitive phrase with three adjectives?

## ADJ x 3

::: {.incremental}
![three adjectives](../../assets/session-3/three-adjectives.png)

- *Note*: Sometimes the search results will contain parsing errors. (We will come back to this topic on Day 4.)
:::

---

# Task E - Collocation (Skip if no time)

## Collocation search

- This is main topic for Day 3.
- Briefly, `collocates` search allows us to search for co-occurring words within specified window.

## Collocation search

1. Select `collocates`

![collocation](../../assets/session-3/collocation-search.png)

## Collocation search

2. Enter search word

![entering words](../../assets/session-3/collocation-search.png)

## Collocation search

- Optional enter the word to look for

![enter collocates](../../assets/session-3/collocation-search.png)

## Collocation search

3. Specify window 

- How distant do you search for the collocates

![window](../../assets/session-3/collocation-search.png)

## Search Methods Summary

::: {style="font-size:75%"}

| Method | Purpose | Example | Key Features |
|--------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Simple Word** | Find exact word forms | `run` → finds only "run" | - Case sensitive<br>- Single form only |
| **LEMMA** | Find all forms of a word | `RUN` → finds "run, runs, ran, running" | - Use CAPITAL letters<br>- Includes all inflections |
| **POS Tag** | Find words by grammatical category | `run_N` (noun)<br>`run_V` (verb) | - Disambiguates word classes<br>- Use underscore + tag |

:::

## Search Methods Summary

::: {style="font-size:75%"}

| Method | Purpose | Example | Key Features |
