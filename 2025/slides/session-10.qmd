# Warm-up question

## Warm-up question

- When you learned Grammar in your second language, was it difficult? 
  - Which rule was easy for you to learn to use?
  - Which rule was challenging for you to learn to use?


## Overview

- Grammatical complexity strand
- Fine-grained grammatical feature strand
- Register-based / Multi-Dimensional Analysis strand
- Syntactic Sophistication strand


## Syntactic complexity

In much SLA research, **syntactic complexity** has been used.

- Indicators of **proficiency** and **development**

## Syntactic complexity strand

Syntactic complexity measures are categorized into:

  - Type 1: `lengths of production`
  - Type 2: `Sentence complexity`
  - Type 3: `Subordination`
  - Type 4: `Coordination`
  - Type 5: `Particular structures`

But before talking about each, we need to define units we use.

## Unit Of Analysis 

Unit of analysis is a terminology to indicate `at which level` you will conduct your analysis

- **Lexical richness**: word as unit of analysis
- **Phraseological complexity**: collocation, phrasal verb, etc.
- **Syntactic complexity**: Sentence, clause, etc.

## Sentence

- A sentence (in English) is a unit starting with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark such as period, question mark, and exclamation mark.

## T-unit

- Writing researchers often use Terminal-Unit (T-unit; Hunt, 1965) as unit of analysis.
  - **T-unit**: An independent clause plus any dependent clauses attached to it 


```
2 T-units: [The researcher loves vocabulary too much] [and he loves coffee too.]
1 T-units: [The researcher loves vocabulary and coffee too much because they have much in common.]
```

## How many T-units do the following example have?

1. Because I was tired, I decided to take a break and watch a movie.
2. I completed my assignment early, so I helped my friend review his draft, and we both felt more confident about our work.

| Type | Measure | Code | Score |
|------|-------------|----|------|
| Lengths | Mean length of clause | MLC | (5+8+9) / 3 = 7.333 |
| Lengths | Mean length of sentence | MLS | 22 /1 = 22 |
| Lengths | Mean lengths of T-unit | MLT | (5+8+9) / 3 = 7.333 |
| Sentence | Clause per sentence | C/S | 3 / 1 = 3 |

Because I was tired, I decided to take a break and watch a movie.

| Type | Measure | Code | Score |
|------|-------------|----|------|-----|
| Subordination | Clauses per T-unit | C/T | 2 / 1 = 2 |
| Subordination | Complex T-units per T-unit | CT/T | 1/1 = 1 |
| Subordination | Dependent clauses per clause | DC/C | 1/2 = 0.5 |
| Subordination | Dependent clauses per T-unit | DC/T | 1/1 = 1 |
| Coordination | Coordinate phrases per clause | CP/C | 1/2 = 0.5 |
| Coordination | Coordinate phrases per T-unit | CP/T | 1/1 = 1 |
| Coordination | T-units per sentence | T/S | 1/1 = 1|

:::


## Syntactic complexity measures - Phrasal

Some complexity measures are at phrasal levels.

::: {style="font-size:70%"}

| Type | Measure | Code |
|------|-------------|----|
| Phrasal | Complex nominals per clause | CN/C |
| Phrasal | Complex nominals per T-unit | CN/T |
| Phrasal | Verb phrases per T-unit | VP/T |

- Complex nominals:
  - nouns plus adjective, posessive, prepositional phrase, adjective clause, participle or appositive
  - nominal clauses
  - gerunds and infinitives in subject, but not object position

## Organic approaches 

::: {style="font-size:90%"}
- Norris & Ortega (2009) proposed an **organic approach** to look at the syntactic complexity.
  - Critisized over-reliance on small number of measures (e.g., length-based measures)
  - Move beyond whether or not complex; ask **HOW**.
- Researchers should select measures that reflect developmentally sensitive measures (Lambert & Kormos, 2014)

## Impact of situational variable on complexification

::: {style="font-size:80%"}
- Traditionally, researchers relied on **Subordinate clauses** . 
- However, Biber showed that subordination is a characteristics of oral langauge. 
- Instead, **nominalization** is one important feature of complexity in written language.

## Discussion

- Any clarification questions?
- Have you thought of using any syntactic complexity measures in your study?


# Fine-grained syntactic complexity strand

## Fine-grained syntactic complexity strand

Criticism on the (largely) length-based grammatical complexity:

- Does not tell us about **how sentence structures are elaborated**

## Length-based indices does not tell elaboration strategy

- (a) The *athletic* man *in the jersey* kicked the ball *over the fence*.
  - Elaborated by phrases (adjectival modification; prepositional phrases)
- (b) **Because he wanted to score a goal**, the man kicked the ball.
  - Elaborated by subordinate clause.

Example from Kyle & Crossley (2018)

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- Kyle & Crossley (2018) proposed fine-grained clausal & phrasal complexity indices
- They used `dependency` parsing to identify fine-grained features of grammar.

## Clausal indices

The followings are example: 

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

| Structure | Dependency tag | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Nominal subject | `nsubj` | The **athlete** ran quickly. | 
| Direct object | `dobj` | He plays **soccer**. |
| Indirect object | `iobj` | He teaches **me** soccer. | 
| Clausal complement | `ccomp` | I am certain **that he did it**. | 
| Adjectival complement | `acomp` | He looks **fine**. |
| Nominal complement | `ncomp` | She is a **teacher**. |

:::

## Clausal indices (Oblique)

The followings are example: 

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}


| Structure | Abbreviation | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Adverbial modifier | `advmod` | **Accordingly**, I ate pizza. |
| Prepositional modifier | `prep` | They went **into the score**. |
| Temporal modifier | `tmod` | Last **night**, we had fun. |
| Adverbial clause | `advcl` | The accident happened **as night fell**.|
| Open clausal complement | `xcomp` | I am ready **to leave**. |

:::


## Phrasal indices

- Phrasal indices counts how many dependents there are for each of the following structure: `nsubj`, `nsubj_pass`, `agent`, `ncomp`, `dobj`, `iobj`, `pobj`.

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}


| Structure | Abbreviation | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Determiners | `det` | **The** man went into **the** store. |
| Prepositional phrases | `prep` | the man **in the red hat**. |
| Adjective modifier | `amod` | The man in the **red** hat |
| Possessives | `poss` | **Tom's** store; **his** intention |
| Relative clause modifiers | `recmod` | the plan **I thought** |
| Adverbial modifiers | `advmod` | It's a **really** good idea. |


:::

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- They counted fine-grained clausal and phrasal indices.
- \# dependents per clause/phrase
- They examined correlations between TOEFL score and the fine-grained indices

## Results

::::

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- The fine-grained indices:
  - explained more variances (~ 20%) than traditional complexity measures (~ 5%)
  - provides more insights into what structure the learners tend to use
- In hands-on activity, we will talk more about how to identify fine-grained grammatical features.


# Register / Multi-Dimensional Analysis strand

## Register / Multi-Dimensional Analysis strand

- This approach dates back to Biber (1988)
- He compared **written** and **spoken** language
- He developed Multidimensional Analysis
  - Approach to characterize the grammatical features that distinguish registers using factor analysis.


## Multidimensional analysis

- Prepare corpora from different textual genres (conversation, essay, recipe, etc.)
- Extract over 100 grammatical features (see next slide)
- Through factor analysis, examine how many *groups* of features (= **dimension**) can explain the linguistic variation in the corpus.
- Calculate dimension scores for each text


## Examples of linguistic features

::: {style="font-size: 70%"}

| Large Category | List of features |
|--------|---------------|
| Pronouns and Proverbs| `First person`, `Second person`, `Pronoun it`, `Proverb do` |
| Reduced Forms | `contractions`, `complementizer that-deletion` |
| Prepositional phrases | `All prepositional phrases` |
| Nouns and noun types | `Concrete noun`, `Cognitive noun`, `place noun`, `group noun`, etc. |
| Verbs and verb types | `tense aspect`, `modal verbs`, `mental verbs`, `causative verb`, etc. |
| complement clauses | `that complement`, `wh-complement` |
| Nominal Postmodifying clauses | `That relative clauses`, `wh-relative clauses` |

# Syntactic sophistication strand

## Syntactic sophistication (or VAC) strand

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}

::: {.incremental}
According to **construction grammar** (Goldberg, 1995, 2006), grammatical construction (structure) convey abstract linguistic meaning. 

| Construction | Syntactic Frame | Semantic Frame | Examples |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| transitive | `nsubj`-root-`dobj` | agent-V-theme | He loves coffee and skill acquisition theory. |
| ditransitive | `nsubj`-root-`iobj`-`dobj` | agent-V-recipient-theme | I teach you NLP. |
| caused motion | `nsubj`-root-`dobj`-`obl` | agent-V-theme-destination | Pat sneezed the foam off the cappuccino. |
| resultative | `nsubj`-root-`dobj`-`xcomp` | agent-V-theme-result | She kissed him unconscious. |

## Approximating Verb Argument Construction (VAC)

::: {style="font-size: 70%"}
- Kyle (2016) used "syntactic frame" based on dependency parsing to approximate VAC.
- He calculated frequency and SOA between `main verb` and `syntactic frame`.

| Main verb lemma | Verb Argument Construction | Example | Freq (PMW) in COCA |
|-----|--------------|--------------|----|
| be | subject-verb-nominal complement | **It** is an **indication** of the ways... | 34,517.41 |
| say | subject ‚Äì verb - clausal complement | **He** said **[that health decisions should be made by patients and doctors]** | 3865.16 |
| refuse | subject - verb - xcomp | He refused to brew a coffee to me. | 5540.0 |
| suppose | nsubj-v-ccomp | I suppose that the theory might be wrong. | 3016.0„ÄÄ|
| suppose | |  |  |
