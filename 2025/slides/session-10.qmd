## Grammatical complexity

- Indicators of 
  - proficiency
  - development


## Grammatical complexity strand

- Length-based indices
  - Number of words per T-unit
- Subordination


## T-unit

- When it comes to measuring grammatical complexity, one important consideration is how to define linguistic unit.
- Writing researchers use T-Unit (Hunt, 1966)
  - **T-unit**: "Independent clause plus any subordinate clauses attached to it"

## Typical grammatical complexity measures

![complexity measures reported in Kyle & Crossley (2018)](../../assets/session-10/complexity-list.png)


## Findings


<!-- ### Length-based measure

### Phrasal complexity

| Measure | Example |
|------|------|
| CN/N | complex nominals per clause |

### Nominal complexity
 -->


## Organic approach (Norris & Ortega, 2009)


## Fine-grained grammatical complexity strand

Criticism on the (largely) length-based grammatical complexity:

- Does not tell us about **how sentence structures are elaborated**

## Length-based indices does not tell elaboration strategy

- (a) The *athletic* man *in the jersey* kicked the ball *over the fence*.
  - Elaborated by phrases (adjectival modification; prepositional phrases)
- (b) **Because he wanted to score a goal**, the man kicked the ball.
  - Elaborated by subordinate clause.

Example from Kyle & Crossley (2018)

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- Kyle & Crossley (2018) proposed fine-grained clausal & phrasal complexity indices
- They used `dependency` parsing to identify fine-grained features of grammar.

## Clausal indices

The followings are example: 

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

| Structure | Dependency tag | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Nominal subject | `nsubj` | The **athlete** ran quickly. | 
| Direct object | `dobj` | He plays **soccer**. |
| Indirect object | `iobj` | He teaches **me** soccer. | 
| Clausal complement | `ccomp` | I am certain **that he did it**. | 
| Adjectival complement | `acomp` | He looks **fine**. |
| Nominal complement | `ncomp` | She is a **teacher**. |

## Clausal indices (Oblique)

The followings are example: 

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}


| Structure | Abbreviation | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Adverbial modifier | `advmod` | **Accordingly**, I ate pizza. |
| Prepositional modifier | `prep` | They went **into the score**. |
| Temporal modifier | `tmod` | Last **night**, we had fun. |
| Adverbial clause | `advcl` | The accident happened **as night fell**.|
| Open clausal complement | `xcomp` | I am ready **to leave**. |


:::


## Phrasal indices

- Phrasal indices counts how many dependents there are for each of the following structure: `nsubj`, `nsubj_pass`, `agent`, `ncomp`, `dobj`, `iobj`, `pobj`.

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}


| Structure | Abbreviation | Example of Structure | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| Determiners | `det` | **The** man went into **the** store. |
| Prepositional phrases | `prep` | the man **in the red hat**. |
| Adjective modifier | `amod` | The man in the **red** hat |
| Possessives | `poss` | **Tom's** store; **his** intention |
| Relative clause modifiers | `recmod` | the plan **I thought** |
| Adverbial modifiers | `advmod` | It's a **really** good idea. |

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- They counted fine-grained clausal and phrasal indices.
- \# dependents per clause/phrase
- They examined correlations between TOEFL score and the fine-grained indices

## Kyle & Crossley (2018)

- The fine-grained indices:
  - explained more variances (~ 20%) than traditional complexity measures (~ 5%)
  - provides more insights into what structure the learners tend to use
- In hands-on activity, we will talk more about how to identify fine-grained grammatical features.



## Syntactic sophistication (or VAC) strand

According to **construction grammar** (Goldberg, 1995, 2006), grammatical construction (structure) convey abstract linguistic meaning. 

In turn, 

- Intransitive: 
- Transitive: 


## Descriptive (register-based feature) strand
