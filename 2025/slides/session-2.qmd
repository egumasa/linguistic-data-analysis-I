# Corpus linguistics: Definition

## Corpus linguistics 

- the investigation of **linguistic research question**

- that have been framed _in terms of **the conditional distribution of linguisitc phenomena**_ 

- in a _**linguistic corpus**_.

(Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 56)


## A linguistic Corpus

A linguistic corpus is:

- searchable digital collection of
- real-world language use
- often accompanied by meta-data describing the contextual parameters

â†’ A corpus documents "recorded observation of language behavior" 


# Why we bother with corpus?

when we can ask native speakers?

## Common criticism to corpus linguistics

1. Corpus documents performance not competence
2. Corpus is incomplete
3. It provides language forms but not meaning
4. Corpus does not give negative evidence

â†’ First two points are worth elaborating.


## Some researchers (particulary generative linguists) say...

1. Corpus may not tell us about "competence"
  - There is an assumption that "competence" (Language Acquisition Device) exists
  - Performance data is too noisy to get to the actual competence

## Some researchers (particulary generative linguists) say...

2. Corpus is imcomplete...
  - because corpus size is finite we cannot really tap into what native speakers will be able to say about the language 

â†’ Corpus linguists **respectfully** disagree with these statements.

## Why Can't We Trust Our Intuition?


## Guess the frequency! Test your intuition

::: {style = "font-size: 70%"}

Rank the following words by frequency in iWeb (14 billion word Web Corpus): 

- the
- obvious
- dog
- absolutely 
- meaningful
- chair
- and

Don't turn to next slide until you finish sorting!

:::

## The frequency rank in iWeb corpus

::: {style = "font-size: 80%"}

| word | freq | freq per million |
|----|-----|-----|
| the | 746240010 | 53,332.79 |
| and | 387613768 | 27,666.94 |
| dog | 1447231 | 103.30 |
| absolutely | 1027853 | 73.37 |
| obvious |715011| 51.04 |
| chair | 621975 | 44.40 |
| meaningful | 297635 | 21.24 |

:::

## Test Your Intuition - 2

- Is the following expressions grammatical? Yes or No?
  
  - different from
  - different than
  - different to

## What corpus has to say about them?

- Given this data, how would you describe the pattern?

![different + from/to/than](../../assets/session-2/different-fromtothan.png)


## Your intuition may have failed because:

- We notice unusual things, not common ones
  - Language frequency AND our physical world are different
  - Our intuition is also affected by our other sensory modes and cognitive mechanisms

## Reliability of intuited "data"

- Intuited data is vulnerable
  - No one experienced every linguistic varieties spoken in the world.
  - The cognitive process to judge grammaticality will be different from usual language processing interpreting the "meaning".


## It doesn't matter the N

::: {style = "font-size: 80%"}

- I searched this construction over News on the web (NOW) corpus which is 22.5 billion+	corpus across 20 countries.
- It is not actually exclusive to the British construction.

# Create corpus data
corpus_data <- data.frame(
  corpus = c("BNC", "COCA", "GLOWBE", "iWeb", "NOW"),
  size = c(0.1, 1.0, 1.9, 13.9, 16.2),  # Size in billions
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Order by size
corpus_data$corpus <- factor(corpus_data$corpus, 
                             levels = corpus_data$corpus[order(corpus_data$size)])

    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )
```


## Limitations of Corpus

- Corpus is incomplete; impossible to reflect all the linguistic variations.
- provides distributional information, but not interpretation
- limited contextual information
- does not tell us about language processing

Corpus has to be selected in relation to the purpose of the study

## Summary

- Corpus can provide information about how people are actually using the language
- May not be complete; but big enough to tell us something more than a small group of individuals can say about the language use
  - Prescriptive vs Descriptive
- Corpus also has limitation
  - Corpus is finite
  - Corpus data needs to be interpreted (but better than intuiting).

# Any questions?

# Part 2: Corpus linguistics as a scientific method

## What do you think is important in scientific process?

- So far we have talked about how corpus can be useful as a method of inquiry.
- We have not talked about how corpus can be integrated in the research process.

â†’ Let's talk about general research cycle then we will go over with corpus examples.

## Scientific research cycle

![Research Process](../../assets/session-2/research-process.png)

## Let's do it together

1. Verbalize your initial questions
2. Formulate research questions
3. Formulate research hypothesis
4. Operationalize - defining the construct so we can measure
5. Test it
6. Evaluate the hypothesis

## Step 1: Starting from question or curiosity

Research is mostly driven by curiosity.

- Is "sort of" used exclusively in spoken discourse? If not what written genre might include this?
- What adjectives are commonly used to modify "stair"?
- Where is the contraction form "gonna" more likely to be used in English?

## Your turn

- In pair, exchange what you've wondered about the English language use in context.
  - Focus on vocabulary, grammar, and possibly discourse
  - We cannot unfortunately look at phonetics/phonology in this class...

- After sharing your curiosity, we will then use that to frame the research question.

## Step 2: Turning curiosity into research question

A research question often involves **relations** between two or more **constructs**.

## What are constructs?

- Constructs are simply theoretical concepts we are interested in researching.

- Linguistic constructs
  - Words, Grammar, etc.
- Extra-linguistic constructs
  - TIME
  - REGION
  - GENRE
  - PROFICIENCY LEVEL

## Research question templates

::: {style = "font-size:75%"}

In corpus-driven linguistic research, we tend to ask following questions:

- How does the frequency of word X change over time?
- How does the frequency of word X differ across text types Z?
- What is the frequency distribution of grammatical pattern X across different text types?
- What are the typical contexts in which expression X appears based on concordance analysis?
- How do different varieties of language Y (e.g., British vs. American English) differ in frequency and contexts of feature X?
- How does register (formal/informal) affect both the frequency and typical contexts of linguistic feature X?

:::

## Your turn: 

- In the same pair, try turning your curiosity into formalized research question.
- Share the research questions to class.


## Step 3: Turning question into hypothesis

**Research Q**: "Is the expression 'gonna' more frequent in informal genres?"

**Hypothesis**: "I expect 'gonna' to occur more frequently in TV/Movie subtitles than in Magazine texts because..."


## Your turn - Writing hypothesis

In the same pair, you will be writing your hypothesis.

**Template**: "I expect [specific pattern] because [reasoning based on experience/knowledge]"


---

## Step 4: Choosing a corpus based on your research question and hypothesis

How can I select the one for my research?

## Three key properties of corpus

1. **Authentic**: 
   - Corpus reflects real-language use
   
2. **Representative**:
   - Corpus should be sampled to reflect some portion of language use.
  
3. **Large**: 
   - Corpus should be in sufficient size to allow investigation

## Authenticity

- It has to be authentic language use (= language used for real communication)
  - No invented sentences
  - No fake data or simulation

- **BUT**... Debate on authenticity
  - How about elicited data?
  - Particularly relevant to learner corpora
    - Timed essay writing for English exam

## Representativeness

- How do researchers try to take representative sample of language use?
- What makes a corpus representative?

## Representative in relation to your purpose

- Representativeness is evaluated based on
  - coverage of important situational variables
  - relative size in the corpus (balances)

- Think of a stratified random sampling approach

## Describing situational variables

Discuss in pair/group:

If you were to create following corpus, what should you include in your corpus?
Choose one and brainstorm the data sources you need to collect.

- how English is currently used in the US
- how English/Japanese is used in US/Japanese universities
- how certain dialect changes overtime

## Corpus Representativeness

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Multiple factors affecting linguistic variations can be used to balance corpus sampling:

- **Linguistic variation** = "toâ€€anyâ€€formâ€€ofâ€€languageâ€€delineableâ€€fromâ€€otherâ€€formsâ€€alongâ€€cultural,â€€linguisticâ€€orâ€€demographic criteria" (Stefanowitsch, 2020, p. 28)
  - **genre**
  - **register**
  - **style**

But see Biber and Conrad (2019) for different definitions of each factor.
:::

## Genre

- category of speech event or text defined in terms of their communicative purpose in culture
  - recipe
  - manuals 
  - academic paper 
  - news report
  - etc.

## Register 

- variety in a set of linguistic features associated with a particular situation of language use. 
  - register of: 
    - academic paper
    - recipe

## Style 

- Stefanowitsch defines: "the degrees of formality" (e.g. formal, informal, colloquial, humorous)
- Biber & Conrad (2019) linguistic variety often associated *within* a register or genre
  - due to the author, specific speech community, etc.


## In case of learner corpora

Additional variables such as:

- First language
- Second-language proficiency levels
- Their learning experiences

## From Question to Corpus Choice

Let's say you want to investigate the following question:

- "Is `passive construction` (be + past participle) more frequent in formal genres?"

**What information do you need in the corpus?**

Try giving some answers in pairs.


## Typical answer

- Has multiple genres (formal AND informal)
- Recent enough to include `passive construction` (be + past participle)
- Large enough to compare

## Gnowing Size - Good or bad?

The corpus is becoming larger and larger.

- Is this a good thing?
- Any drawbacks we might foresee?


## Steps 4-6: In Session 3

4. Operationalize = Define exactly what to search
5. Test = Actually search the corpus
6. Evaluate = Interpret your results

We'll practice these with real searches in Session 3!

---

# Reflection

- Did your view on the linguistic intuition change? If so how?
- Explain three key property of a linguistic corpus using examples.


<!-- ---

## Linguistic phenomena

- We have mostly talked about *word*.
- However, corpus linguists are interested in more than words.

Examples: 

- Multiword Units (play + role, a number of X, )
- Grammar (if-clause, relative clause)

## Multiword Units (More on Day 3)

With corpus methods, we can investigate how two or more words co-occur together.

- What does the word "XXX" occur together in English?

- Any guesses?

## Collocates

In COCA, the following word co-occur with "dog":
(Collocates = words that frequently co-occur with the node word.)

<insert table>

## Fill in the blank

- "On the other _____"
- 

- How do you know?



## Corpus gives you some ideas

- **Simple answer**: They are used together so often.
- **Corpus answer**: Given the sequence "on the other", the probability of seeing the word "hand" next is very high.
  â†’ Their **Strengths Of Association (SOA)** is high.

<insert >

- We will cover how to calculate simple SOA measures on Day 3.


## Grammar (More on Day 4)

We can do similar with grammar (or morpho-syntax).

- How often do we expect "by X" construction in passive construction.

## Frequency of "by X" in passive construction

<insert>


## Corpus linguistics =

- the investigation of **linguistic research question**

- that have been framed _in terms of **the conditional distribution of linguisitc phenomena**_ 

- in a _**linguistic corpus**_. -->
