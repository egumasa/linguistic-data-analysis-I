# Session overview


## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

> By the end of this session, students will be able to:
> 
> - Define corpus linguistics as an empirical methodology
> - Explain key limitations of introspection in linguistic research
> - Describe the role of frequency data and patterns in corpus analysis
> - Identify and explain the basic steps in corpus-based research
> - Reflect on their own stance toward data, intuition, and linguistic evidence

# What corpus is

- Searchable digital collection
- Collection of real-world language use
- Often accompanied by meta-data describing the contextual parameters


---

# Common criticism to corpus linguistics

## Common criticism

1. corpora are usage data and thus of no use in studying linguistic knowledge;  
2. corpora and the data derived from them are necessarily incomplete;
3. corpora contain only linguistic forms (represented as graphemic strings), but no information about the semantics, pragmatics, etc. of these forms; and  
4. corpora do not contain negative evidence, i.e., they can only tell us what is possible in a given language, but not what is not possible.

# 

- Intuition data is not as reliable or valid as corpus data.
- However, intuition can provide a hypothesis to test


---

# Test our intuitions

List the following words in order of the frequency in English


- <List 5 words here; with high, mid, low frequency band>

---

- Corpus is at least gives you the same answer


---

# Limitations of corpus

- provides distributional information, but not interpretation

- 

- Limited contextual information

-

# Summary


# Reflection

- How is the use of speaker knowledge differ in generative linguistic tradition vs the corpus linguistics? Use intuition and interpretation.
