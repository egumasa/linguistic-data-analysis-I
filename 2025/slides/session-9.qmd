## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}

As a wrap-up of the vocabulary and multiword sessions, you will be able to:

> - Conduct mini learner corpus research.
>   - Construct several learner corpus research questions with structured support.
>   - Choose a learner corpus that suit your research needs
>   - Justify choices of lexical richness measures to investigate a research questions
>   - Compute lexical richness indices and analyze the results to answer research questions
>   - Present the results and interpretation of the findings in a written prose

## Mini-research outline

1. Construct research questions
2. Understand and choose the learner corpus
3. Construct hypothesis
4. Select index
5. Compute the index
6. Conduct analysis 
7. Interpret and write-up the results


## Step 1: Construct research questions

Researchers typically set RQs about the relationships between lexical characteristncs and variables that defines subsection of the corpus (e.g., grade, genre, or proficieincy score).


## Step 2: Understand and choose the corpus

In this assignment, please choose one of the following corpora:

1. *Growth in Grammar (GiG) corpus* (Durrant, 2023)
2. *ICNALE corpus* (Edited Essay OR GRA)
3. If you have a corpus you want to analyze, let Masaki know!

## Understanding the corpus contents

- You can look at followings:
  - meta-data (the additional information about the corpus files)
  - several text files

## GiG corpus

- For detailed information, see Table 2.1 in Durrant (2023)

## ICNALE GRA

ICNALE GRA documents 120 essays evaluated by 80 people.
- These 80 people are from different backgrounds.
- You can basically use average essay ratings.

## Step 1 & 2: Formluating research questions

:::{style="font-size:75%"}
What would you like to know? 

- How learners develop their language ability across time?
- What defines "more proficient" language use?
- How situational variables of writing/speaking impact the language production?
- How does production of X change across time/proficiency?
- Anything else?

- Do not forget to specify **constructs**!
:::

## Step 2: Choosing a right corpus

Based on the research question, which corpus should you choose?

1. *Growth in Grammar (GiG) corpus* (Durrant, 2023)
2. *ICNALE corpus* (Edited Essay OR GRA)

- Understand what it offers and doesn't.
- Pick one corpus to move forward.

## Step 3: Construct hypothesis

- Once you've articulated broad research questions and chose a corpus, speculate on possible results.
- Use what you've learned so far about lexical richness.
  - Lexical diversity
  - Lexical sophistication
  - Phraseological complexity
- Which ones are relevant to your questions?

## Step 4: Select index

Let's keep going!

Specifically, which index may capture the change in the vocabulary use in your context?

- List posssible indices to capture the differences in vocabulary use.
- Why do you think those are good choices?

## Step 5: Compute the index

Okay now it's time to do some analysis!

- Which ones are you going to use:
  - TAALED
  - TAALES
  - Lexical profiler
  - Custom list in Simple Text Analyzer?


## Step 6: Conduct analysis 

Once you obtained the indices, it's time to understand the pattern by plotting.

- Use simple analyzer to plot data from:
  - GiG corpus
  - ICNALE
- The simple text analyzer is made for that purpose.

## Step 7: Interpret and write-up the results

Now you understand what is happening in your corpus, you can write that up.

7. Interpret and write-up the results

# Let's work!

Let us know if you have any questions.


## Reflection

- You can now:
  - Provide reasons for your choice of lexical richness measures.
  - Conduct preliminary analysis to understand how text differ from one aother in relation to learner's proficiency, learner groups, etc.
