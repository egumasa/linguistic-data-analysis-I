## One-liner



## Learning Objectives

> By the end of this session, students will be able to:
> 
> - Describe how LLMs are trained generally and what LLMs do to produce language.
> - Demonstrate/discuss potential impacts of prompts on the LLMs performance on linguistic annotation.
> - Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using LLMs for linguistic annotation.
> - Design an experiment to investigate LLMs output accuracy on a given annotation task.
