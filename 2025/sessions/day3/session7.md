## One-liner


## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

> - Explain different types of multiword units: collocation, n-grams, lexical bundles
> - Demonstrate how major association strengths measures (t-score, Mutual Information, and LogDice) are calculated using examples

## üîë Key Concepts

- Types of multiword units
- Association strengths
- Three approaches:
    - Context window
    - Dependency bigram

## Reflection

- You can now:
  - Describe major types of multiword units and how they differ from each other
    - N-gram, Lexical Collocations, Colligations, lexical bundle
  - Describe benefits and drawbacks of major Strengths Of Association (SOA) measures
  - Discuss two approaches to identify collocation from the text: window-based approach and dependency-based approach.
