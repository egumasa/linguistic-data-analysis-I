subtitle: "Learner Corpus Mini-Research"
---

## One-liner

You will conduct learner corpus mini-research.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

> - Justify choices of lexical richness measures to investigate a research questions
> - Conduct a simple statistical analysis of selected corpus on small sets of lexical measures using JASP software

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- Linear regression analysis (group comparison or prediction)
- Introduction to in-class mini-project

## 📚 Required Readings

- No new reading! (please re-read Eguchi & Kyle, 2020)

## Reflection

- You can now:
  - Provide reasons for your choice of lexical richness measures.
  - Conduct preliminary analysis to understand how text differ from one aother in relation to learner's proficiency, learner groups, etc.
  - Brainstorm your ideas for your final project.
