## One-liner


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

> By the end of this session, students will be able to:
> 
> - Provide historical overview of the syntactic complexity research
> - Describe different approaches to grammatical features:
>   - Grammatical complexity strand
>   - Fine-grained grammatical complexity strand
>   - Descriptive (register-based analysis) strand
>   - Verb Argument Construction (VAC) strand
> - Understand current trends of syntactic complexity research


## 🔑 Key Concepts

- Grammatical complexity
- Predictive measures versus Descriptive measures
