2. **Consider Searchability**: Make sure your chosen items can be searched in English-Corpora.org
3. **Think About Comparison**: Many good research questions involve comparing two or more items
4. **Use Multiple Searches**: Plan to conduct both frequency searches and concordance analysis
5. **Consider Time Periods**: If looking at change over time, choose reasonable time spans available in the corpus
6. **Choose Topics You're Interested In**: Research is more engaging when you care about the topic
7. **Think About Your Own Language Learning**: What expressions confused you? What differences surprised you?
