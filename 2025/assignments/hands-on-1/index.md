- Write one or two research questions you would like to answer through this assignment.


### Hypothesis:

- Once you decided on research question, state your hypothesis.
- Use the course material to help you articulate research hypothesis.
- Write a short paragraph stating your hypothesis and why you think your research hypotheses may be true.


## Task 2: Methods

In this task, you are asked to describe the methods choice of your corpus search. This should include justifications for the corpora used, type of corpus search used.

### Corpora

- Which corpora or sub-section of a corpus would you conduct a search on? Why? Justify your choice in a paragraph.
