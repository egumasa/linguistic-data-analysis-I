# Assignment Overview

This assignment aims to help you practice the following skills:

- Constructing lists of formulaic language through concordance software
- Planning and conducting a small-scale corpus study using single- and multi-word indices


# Assignment Details


## Task 1: Describing statistical characteristics of collocations (4 points)

In the first task, I would like you to calculate major Strengths Of Association (SOA) measures to quantify the association between two words (`node words` and `their collocates`.)

The frequency of node words, their collocates and entire corpus size will be given to you.

Your task is to calculate T-score, MI, MI^2, and LogDice.

## Submission

- A spreadsheet file with SOA values.
- A word file (`.docx`) for plots and prose descriptions.

# Success Criteria

Your submission ...

- [ ] contains accurate T-score, MI, MI^2 and LogDice scores
- [ ] provides visualization of the relations between SOA indices
- [ ] describe the relationships among SOA indices and typical collocations

## Task 2 & 3: Mini-research project (8 points altogether)


The task 2 and 3 are related to the mini-research project.

In this part of the assignment, you will conduct a mini-research project to describe uses of single- and multi-word units in a corpus you choose.

Specifically, you will:

- select lexical richness or phraseological sophistication indices to answer a set of research questions
- analyze the chosen corpus with the selected indices
- present the results and interpretation in a written prose

### Corpus choice

In this assignment, please choose one of the following corpora:

1. *Growth in Grammar (GiG) corpus* (Durrant, 2023)
2. *British Academic Written English*
3. Some Japanese corpus here (Ask Masaki about availability).

## Submission

- A word file which 
  - describe the selected lexical richness and phraseological indices;
  - briefly explain the content of the corpus you investigated;
  - provides analysis procesure
  - provides results of the analysis (e.g., visualization and/or statistical tests)
  - discusses implication of your analysis
