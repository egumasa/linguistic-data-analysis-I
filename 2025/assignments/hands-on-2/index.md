# Assignment Overview

This assignment aims to help you practice the following skills:

- Creating a word frequency list based on a corpus of Japanese (as an example of non-English language)
- Computing and interpreting lexical diversity scores for English text samples
- Computing and interpreting lexical sophistication indices for English text samples


# Assignment Details

Complete the following three tasks. Submit a single word file with write-up of each task, with appendix in specified file formats.

Submit the finished assignment through Google Classroom.


## Task 1: A Japanese word frequency List

### Goals

The goal of this task is to:

- Construct a Japanese word frequency list.

### Instruction

- Use `Aozora 500` corpus.
- Create frequency list using `TagAnt` and `AntConc`
- Understand frequency distributions using simple text analyzer.

::: {.callout-note}
## Submission: 

- A Japanese word frequency list (`.txt` or `.tsv` format)
- Descriptive paragraphs explaining the frequency distributions of Japanese language.

# Success Criteria

Your submission ...

- [ ] includes a frequency list of Japanese words based on Aozora 500
- [ ] provides a description of word-frequency patterns in Aozora 500 using example words from each frequency bins

## Task 2: Replication of Figure 4.19 from Durrant with two more recent lexical diversity indices

### Goals

The goals of this task are:

- to compute more recent, robust alternatives to classical indices using TAALED
- to replicate Durrant's analysis with two more recent lexical diversity indices

### Instructions

- Complete the hand calculation of lexical diversity indices on the spreadsheet
- Compute recommended lexical diversity indices — MATTR and MTLD Original — using TAALED.
- Replicate Figure 4.19 in Durrant (2023, p. 72) with the two indices (i.e., MATTR and MTLD Original) 
- Discuss implication of the findings.

::: {.callout-note}
## Submission: 

- Spreadsheet file containing hand-calculated lexical diversity scores.
- Descriptive paragraphs explaining the replication of Durrant's analysis (300 words).
  - Research question
  - Your hypothesis regarding the replication
  - Plots (one for MTLD; the other for MATTR)
  - Results and interpretation

:::

# Success Criteria

Your submission ...

- [ ] includes a spreatsheet that contains lexical diversity (i.e., TTR, Root TTR, Log TTR, MAAS) scores for the sample texts
- [ ] includes a csv file 
- [ ] provides two sets of plots that describe trends of lexical diversity across year groups and genre.
- [ ] provides 200-300 word replication report on lexical diversity trends in GiG corpus, presented as Figure 4.19 in Durrant (2023).

## Task 3: Qualitative analysis of lexical sophistication

### Goal

The goals of this task are to:

- compute several important lexical sophistication indices
- compare and contrast two texts using the selected indices
- describe the use of vocabulary in the two text based on the quantitative and qualitative information

### Instructions

- Two texts from the example used in the classroom
- Using the simple text analyzer, compare two texts based on two indices that you select.
- Select one frequency-based index and another type of index.
- Interpret the results of the analysis and describe the difference in a (few) paragraph(s).

::: {.callout-note}
## Submission: 

- Plots that contains results of the lexical sophistication analysis.
- Descriptive paragraph(s) contrasting two texts based on lexical sophistication (200-300 words).

# Success Criteria

Your submission ...

- [ ] includes plots from one frequency index and one other type of index
- [ ] provides desciption of how two texts differ in terms of the selected lexical sophistication indices.
