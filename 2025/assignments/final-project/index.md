## Project Guidelines

For the final assignment of the current 5-day intensive course, I have two possible plans we can discuss and decide together.

Let's decide **by the end of Day 2**.

## Option A - Conducting a separate mini-project

- Option A is more extensive in that you will be asked to conduct a new mini-project using the toolkit you have learned throughout the course. 
- Given the limited time, however, this plan requires a lot of commitment to the present course and may not be feasible, (but we can try if you'd like!). 
- We will discuss possible alternatives (like Option B below)

## Option B - Revisiting one of the completed Corpus Lab assignments

- As this 5-day intensive course teaches you a lot of new techniques and approaches to analyze lingusitic data, it is important for us to revisit the already completed assignments and consolidate our skills.
- In Option B, you will be asked to make a presentation on one of your previously completed Corpus Lab assignments, clearly articulating the thinking process as well as potential extension of your approach.
- More details will be provided on the first day of the course.
