## Course Information

**Course Title**: Linguistic Data Analysis I  
**Credits**: 2  
**Format**: Intensive 5-day course (15 sessions)  
**Language**: English  
<!-- **Prerequisites**: Graduate standing; no programming experience required   -->
**Classroom**: 113 Lecture room â‘£

## Instructor Information

**Instructor:** Masaki Eguchi, Ph.D. 


## Course Description

This course introduces the foundations of corpus linguistics and the analysis of learner language through corpus linguistic approaches. It covers key concepts in corpus linguistics, including what corpora are, how they are used to answer (applied) linguistic research questions, and how to design corpus-based analyses to address substantive research questions in second language research. The primary language of analysis in this course is English, but students are encouraged to apply the concepts introduced to the languages they work with in their own research.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain what corpus linguistics is and how corpus linguistics can help learn linguistic phenomena
- Search for and select available corpora relevant to their own research
- Discuss design issues related to language corpora for specific research purposes
- Apply introductory corpus linguistic analyses (e.g., frequency analysis, concordancing, POS tagging) to preprocessed corpora
- Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of a corpus linguistic approach to linguistic analysis

## Course Components

- Lectures and tutorials
- Daily Hands-on activities
- Mini-corpus labs
- Final project

## Assignments and Grading

You can find detailed information about each assignment in assignments page (under construction).

We have two possible choices for the grade distribution for this course. I will explain the details of each choice in the first day of the course. The class as a whole decides which one we will incorporate in this course. Once decided, all students will follow the decided plan.

### Grade Distribution â€“ Option A

- For option A, pairs of students will develop their own mini-research and present their final project **on the final day**.

| Assignment |   | Percent  |
|-------|----|----|
| Corpus Lab Assignments | (4 Ã— 15%) | 60% |
| Class Participation |   | 20% |
| Final Project | | 20%|

### Grade Distribution â€“ Option B

- For option B, pairs of students will present on Corpus Lab assignments **on the final day**.

| Assignment |   | Percent  |
|-------|----|----|
| Corpus Lab Assignments | (4 Ã— 15%) | 60% |
| Class Participation |   | 20% |
| Final Presentation on Selected Corpus Lab Assignment | | 20%|


### Grading Scale

We follow [the grading system at Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/japanese/studentinfo/education/01/education0110/).

| Grade | Range | Grade Point |
|-----|-----|--|
| AA | 100-90% | 4.0 |
| A | 89-80% | 3.0 |
| B | 79-70% | 2.0 |
| C | 69-60% | 1.0 |
| D | 59-0% | 0.0 |


## Daily Structure

Each day follows this general pattern:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 10:30-12:00 | Session 1 |
| 12:00-13:00 | Lunch break |
| 13:00-14:30 | Session 2 |
| 14:30-14:40 | Break |
| 14:40-16:10 | Session 3 |
| 16:10-17:00 | Office Hour (You can ask questions.) |
