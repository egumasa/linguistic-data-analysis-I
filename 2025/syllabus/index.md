## Course Description

This course introduces the foundations of corpus linguistics and the analysis of learner language through corpus linguistic approaches. It covers key concepts in corpus linguistics, including what corpora are, how they are used to answer (applied) linguistic research questions, and how to design corpus-based analyses to address substantive research questions in second language research. The primary language of analysis in this course is English, but students are encouraged to apply the concepts introduced to the languages they work with in their own research.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain what corpus linguistics is and how corpus linguistics can help learn linguistic phenomena
- Search for and select available corpora relevant to their own research
- Discuss design issues related to language corpora for specific research purposes
- Apply introductory corpus linguistic analyses (e.g., frequency analysis, concordancing, POS tagging) to preprocessed corpora
- Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of a corpus linguistic approach to linguistic analysis
